IP Into:
  (https://github.com/justindcoleman/networkplus-notes/blob/master/tcp%20packet.PNG)
  TCP => layer 4, multiplexing, connection-oriented, error recovery, ack messages, flow control
  UDP => layer 4, multiplexing, connectionless, no error recovery, no ack, no flow control
  location => ip_address:port#
  IPv4 => server ip address, protocol, server application port number / client ip, protocol, client port number
  non-ephemeral ports => 0-1023, permanent
  ephemeral ports => 1024-65535, determined in real time by client
  port numbers are for communication, not security
  (https://github.com/justindcoleman/networkplus-notes/blob/master/packets%20w%20ports.PNG)
 TCP port numbers aren't the same as UDP (i.e. http on traffic on TCP port 80 doesn't cause an issue for traffic on UDP port 80)
 ICMP: allows devices to check in on each other, administrative uses
 
Common Ports:
  well known port numbers: https://github.com/justindcoleman/networkplus-notes/blob/master/ports.pdf
  telnet: TCP 23 - unencrypted remote control/management software
  SSH: TCP 22 - encrypted remote control/management software
  DNS: UDP 53 - translates alphanumeric (& dashes) into numerical IP addresses
  SMTP: TCP 25 - server to server email transfer, client to server email transfer
  SFTP: TCP 22 - uses SSH as underlying protocol, fulll featured & encrypted (resuming, directory list, remote file removal) file transfer
  FTP: TCP 20 (active mode data transfer) / TCP 21 (control information between client and server) - unencrypted file transfer (list, add, delete), authenticates with username & password
  TFTP: UDP 69 - unencrypted file transfer with no authentication needed
  DHCP: UDP 67, 68 - automated config of IP addresses, subnet mask, and other options, requires a DHCP server, leases addresses from an assigned pool which must be renewed at set intervals, allows DHCP reservatins based on MAC addresses
  HTTP: TCP 80 - web server communication
  HTTPS: TCP 443 - web server communication with encryption
  SNMPv3: UDP 161 - simple network management protocol, gather statistics from network devices, encrypted with authentication
  RDP: TCP 3389 - screen/input remote sharing/control, supports full machine or application, Windows based
  NTP: UDP 123 - synchronizing clocks between devices, automatic, frequency is flexible
  SIP: TCP 5056, 5061 - set up and manage VoIP sessions, supports video conferencing, instant messaging, file transfer
  SMB: TCP 445 - (also called CIFS) file & print sharing for Windows, communicates without NetBIOS support
  POP: TCP 110 - receive emails from an email server (auth & transfer)
  IMAP4: TCP 143 - receive emails from an email server (auth & transfer), includes management of mail box from multiple clients
  LDAP: TCP 389 - store and retrieve information in a network directory
  LDAPS: TCP 636 - LDAP over SSL
