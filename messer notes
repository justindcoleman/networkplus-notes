IP Into:
  TCP => layer 4, multiplexing, connection-oriented, error recovery, ack messages, flow control, 
  UDP => layer 4, multiplexing, connectionless, no error recovery, no ack, no flow control
  location => ip_address:port#
  IPv4 => server ip address, protocol, server application port number / client ip, protocol, client port number
  non-ephemeral ports => 0-1023, permanent
  ephemeral ports => 1024-65535, determined in real time by client
  port numbers are for communication, not security
  well known port numbers: https://www.dropbox.com/s/udpkfosy0s78e6r/ports.pdf?dl=0
 TCP port numbers aren't the same as UDP (i.e. http on traffic on TCP port 80 doesn't cause an issue for traffic on UDP port 80)
 ICMP: allows devices to check in on each other, administrative uses
